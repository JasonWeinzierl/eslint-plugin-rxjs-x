## Issues

To submit a bug or feature request, please first:

1. Use the latest version of this plugin.
2. Search existing issues, including closed issues, for your issue.
    - Since this plugin is a fork, please search the previous repositories too: `cartant/eslint-plugin-rxjs` and `cartant/rxjs-tslint-rules`.
    - Even if your issue is different, please feel free to link to related issues for context. It really helps!

## Getting Started

To start working an issue, first fork this repository.

Then install Yarn with corepack (included in all modern versions of Node.js):

```sh
corepack enable
```

Then run `yarn` in this repository to restore packages.

## Working

### Building

Run `yarn build` to build this plugin into the `dist` folder.

### Linting

Use `yarn lint` to run all linters (ESLint, markdownlint, and eslint-doc-generator).
If the eslint-doc-generator lint step fails,
you may need to run `yarn docs` to auto-update the rule documentation based on your changes.

All linting must pass for a pull request to be accepted.
We recommend you use the VS Code plugins for ESLint and markdownlint during development.

### Testing

Use `yarn test` to run the tests in watch mode or `yarn test --run` for a single run.
We use [vitest](https://vitest.dev) for unit testing.

All unit tests must pass for a pull request to be accepted.
We also enforce code coverage, which you can check with `yarn coverage --coverage.reporter text`.
