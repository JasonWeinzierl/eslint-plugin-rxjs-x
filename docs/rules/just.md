# Require the use of `just` instead of `of` (`rxjs-x/just`)

ðŸ”§ This rule is automatically fixable by the [`--fix` CLI option](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/command-line-interface#--fix).

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

This rule enforces the use of `just` instead of `of`. Some other languages with Rx implementations use the former and this rule is for developers who have that preference.

## When Not To Use It

If you prefer `of` in your project, you will want to avoid this rule.
