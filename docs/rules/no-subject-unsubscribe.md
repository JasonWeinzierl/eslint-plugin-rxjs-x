# Disallow calling the `unsubscribe` method of subjects (`rxjs-x/no-subject-unsubscribe`)

ðŸ’¼ This rule is enabled in the following configs: âœ… `recommended`, ðŸ”’ `strict`.

ðŸ’­ This rule requires [type information](https://typescript-eslint.io/linting/typed-linting).

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

This rule effects failures if the `unsubscribe` method is called on subjects.
The method behaves differently to the `unsubscribe` method on subscriptions and is often an error.

## When Not To Use It

If you intentionally use `unsubscribe` to cause errors when subjects are `next`-ed after closing,
then you don't need this rule.

Type checked lint rules are more powerful than traditional lint rules, but also require configuring type checked linting.
