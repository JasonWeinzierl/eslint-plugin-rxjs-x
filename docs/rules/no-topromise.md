# Disallow use of the `toPromise` method (`rxjs-x/no-topromise`)

ðŸ’¼ This rule is enabled in the following configs: âœ… `recommended`, ðŸ”’ `strict`.

ðŸ’¡ This rule is manually fixable by [editor suggestions](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/core-concepts#rule-suggestions).

ðŸ’­ This rule requires [type information](https://typescript-eslint.io/linting/typed-linting).

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

This rule effects failures if the `toPromise` method is used.

This rule provides two editor suggestions which replace `toPromise` with either:

- `lastValueFrom(...)`, which behaves closest to the behavior of `toPromise`,
- or `firstValueFrom(...)`.

## When Not To Use It

If you rely on RxJS's deprecation of `toPromise` and don't need to double-flag usage,
then you don't need this rule.

Type checked lint rules are more powerful than traditional lint rules, but also require configuring type checked linting.
